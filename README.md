## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use media queries and how to have a mobile-first workflow. This workflow made building the solution much easier, since I had to adjust only a few things once the mobile styling and layout was done.

### Continued development

I wanted to try and use Bootstrap in this project but I figured this isn't the project to test it on. I want to try and use it but I'm not sure when.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Used for quick search of CSS properties.

- [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - I used this to fill in any gaps in my HTML and CSS knowledge. I will continue learning through this course.
